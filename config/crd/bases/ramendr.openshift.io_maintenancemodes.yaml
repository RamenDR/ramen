              MaintenanceModeSpec defines the desired state of MaintenanceMode for a StorageProvisioner
              If a storage or replication backend desires specific maintenance modes to be activated prior to certain
              Ramen actions (for e.g notify backend of ANY failover operation for internal storage preparation), it presents
              its requirements via specific Ramen labels on the appropriate StorageClass or ReplicationClass as detailed
              in the VolumeReplicationGroup status.ProtectedPVCs.StorageIdentifiers fields.
              Ramen orchestration would create required MaintenanceMode resources based on these labels, for the storage
              backed to reconcile and provide its readiness status for the action.
              NOTE: Ramen only creates the MaintenanceMode resource, it is expected to be reconciled by the storage drivers
              by matching the provisioner and the targetID, that is specific to its instance, and update status as detailed
              for Ramen to proceed with its actions

                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
