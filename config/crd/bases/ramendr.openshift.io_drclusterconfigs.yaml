              DRClusterConfigSpec defines the desired state of DRClusterConfig
              It carries information regarding the cluster identity as known at the OCM hub cluster. It is also used to
              advertise required replication schedules on the cluster, if an equivalent DRPolicy resource is created for
              the same at the hub cluster.
              It is expected to be watched and used by storage providers that require meta information regarding the cluster
              and to prepare and manage required storage resources.

                  ReplicationSchedules desired from storage providers for replicating Persistent Volume data to a peer cluster.
                  Values are in the form <num><m,h,d>. Where <num> is a number, 'm' indicates minutes, 'h' means hours and
                  'd' stands for days.
                  Typically used to generate VolumeReplicationClass resources with the desired schedules by storage
