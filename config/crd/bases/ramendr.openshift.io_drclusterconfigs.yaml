              DRClusterConfigSpec defines the desired state of DRClusterConfig
              It carries information regarding the cluster identity as known at the OCM hub cluster. It is also used to
              advertise required replication schedules on the cluster, if an equivalent DRPolicy resource is created for
              the same at the hub cluster.
              It is expected to be watched and used by storage providers that require meta information regarding the cluster
              and to prepare and manage required storage resources.
              It also reports detected configuration and health of the cluster, which is used by the OCM hub cluster to process
              further cross cluster configuration (specifically peerClasses) and report health of the cluster at the hub.
