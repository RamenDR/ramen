              VolumeReplicationGroup (VRG) spec declares the desired schedule for data
              replication and replication state of all PVCs identified via the given
              PVC label selector. For each such PVC, the VRG will do the following:
                - Create a VolumeReplication (VR) CR to enable storage level replication
                  of volume data and set the desired replication state (primary, secondary,
                  etc).
                - Take the corresponding PV cluster data in Kubernetes etcd and deposit it in
                  the S3 store.  The url, access key and access id required to access the
                  S3 store is specified via environment variables of the VRG operator POD,
                  which is obtained from a secret resource.
                - Manage the lifecycle of VR CR and S3 data according to CUD operations on
                  the PVC and the VRG CR.
