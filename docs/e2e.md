# End to End testing

RamenDR end-to-end (e2e) tests validate various scenarios for regional DR
using predefined workloads and deployment methods.

## Running End to End tests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All commands must be ran from the e2e directory.

### Preparing a `config.yaml` file

#### For drenv environment

If `drenv` was used to configure RDR clusters, easily copy `config.yaml.sample`
and add the clusters kubeconfig paths into `config.yaml` using:

```sh
cat config.yaml.sample ~/.config/drenv/rdr/config.yaml > config.yaml
```

#### For real cluster

Create a `config.yaml` file by copying the `config.yaml.sample` template:

```sh
cp config.yaml.sample config.yaml
```

Update `config.yaml` by uncommenting and adding cluster names and kubeconfig paths
for the hub and managed clusters.

```yaml
Clusters:
  hub:
    name: hub
    kubeconfigpath: /path/to/kubeconfig/hub
  c1:
    name: dr1
    kubeconfigpath: /path/to/kubeconfig/c1
  c2:
    name: dr2
    kubeconfigpath: /path/to/kubeconfig/c2
```

### Validating the clusters

Before running tests it is useful to validate that the clusters are accessible
and ready for testing. You can verify it using:

```sh
./run.sh -test.run TestValidation
```

Example output:

```console

    --- PASS: TestValidation/hub (0.02s)
    --- PASS: TestValidation/c1 (0.03s)
    --- PASS: TestValidation/c2 (0.03s)
PASS
```

Our clusters are ready for testing!

### Running DR tests

To run all the DR tests run the TestDR test:

```sh
./run.sh -test.run TestDR
```

The test perform a full DR flow with a tiny workload with multiple deployemnet
methods and storage configurations.

> [!TIP]
> The tests typically complete in 10 minutes, depending the machine running the tests.

When all tests complete we will see a test summary showing the status of all
tests and the time to complete every step:

### Tests configuration

The tests are defined in the configuration file. Each test specifies a deployer
name, workload name, and PVCSpec:

```yaml
tests:
  - deployer: appset
    workload: deploy
    pvcspec: rbd
  ...
```

The tests are generated from the configuration as
"TestDR/{deployer}-{workload}-{pvcspec}-busybox".
See [Running DR tests](#running-dr-tests) section for complete test list.

### Run specific DR tests

Running specific tests is commonly used when debugging a failing test,
developing a new test, or working on a new deployer or workload. It allows to
selectively execute specific tests by matching full test names using regular
expressions, making it easier to focus on specific scenarios.

#### Run a single DR test

Example:

```sh
./run.sh -test.run TestDR/subscr-deploy-rbd-busybox
```

This command runs the specific test for subscription based RBD busybox application.

#### Run DR tests using a specific deployer

Example:

```sh
./run.sh -test.run TestDR/appset
```

This command runs all DR tests related to ApplicationSet, covering both RBD and
CephFS PVC based applications. Useful when focusing on a specific deployer.

#### Run DR tests using a specific storage

Example:

```sh
./run.sh -test.run TestDR/rbd
```

This command runs all DR tests related to RBD PVCs across all deployers. Ideal
for verifying functionality specific to a storage type.

### Using multiple config files

Use this option if you want to maintain multiple configuration files and run
tests using a specific one. Example usage:

```sh
./run.sh -config my_config.yaml
```
