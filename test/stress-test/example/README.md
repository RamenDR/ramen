# Stress Test Example Output

This directory contains example output from a stress test, demonstrating
the reports generated by the stress-test tooling.

## Commands Used

```bash
# Run the stress test
stress-test/run -r 100 -o out/registry-cache-100 envs/regional-dr.yaml

# Generate test report
stress-test/report out/registry-cache-100

# Analyze failures
stress-test/analyze-failures out/registry-cache-100

# Collect system metrics (requires Netdata)
stress-test/collect-metrics out/registry-cache-100

# Generate metric plots and report
stress-test/analyze-metrics out/registry-cache-100

## Generated Reports

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [test.md](test.md) | Test results summary (human-readable) |
| [test.json](test.json) | Test results (machine-readable) |
| [failures.md](failures.md) | Failure analysis with error summary and details |
| [metrics.md](metrics.md) | System metrics charts (for humans) |
| [ai-analysis.md](ai-analysis.md) | AI-generated analysis with recommendations |

Note: CSV files with raw metrics data (metrics/*.csv) are not included due to
their size. In a real test run, these files are generated by `analyze-metrics`
and can be used for AI-assisted analysis.
