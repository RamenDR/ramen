# Example environment using external clusters. The cluster must exist when this
# environment is started.
#
# To try this example, create the cluster with:
#
#     drenv start envs/vm.yaml
#
# Now you can start this environment with:
#
#     drenv start envs/external.yaml
#
# Stopping will run the stop hook, but will not stop the external minikube
# cluster. Deleting does nothing.
