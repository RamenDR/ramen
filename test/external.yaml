# Example environment using external clusters. The cluster `test` must exist
# when this environment is started.
#
# To try this example, create the cluster with:
#
#     drenv start test.yaml
#
# Now you can start this environment with:
#
#     drenv start external.yaml
#
# Stopping will run the stop script, but will not stop the external minikube
# cluster. Deleting does nothing.
